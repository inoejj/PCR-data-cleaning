A simple script to consolidate the whole PCR output data in txt format into a cleaner and readable csv file for data analysis.

# Tutorial

Try playing it yourself by putting all the .txt file in a folder and create a .csv file.

Check your answer with the `rhamp_tape_data.csv` in the `rhamp tape correct extraction dna` folder to see if your output .csv file matches mine.
